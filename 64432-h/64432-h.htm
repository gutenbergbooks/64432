<p class="titlepage larger">THE ANGUISH LANGUISH</p>

<p>English words are astonishingly versatile and could
readily be made to serve a new and extraordinary purpose,
but nobody seems to care about this except SPAL<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
(Society for the Promotion of the Anguish Languish).<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
In keeping with its lofty ideals and its slogan, ANGUISH
FOR EVERYBODY, the Society is sponsoring this little
text, which has three aims:</p>

<p class="hanging">1. To improve the public’s understanding of the
Anguish Languish.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. To improve the academic standing of the
Anguish Languish.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. To improve the social <i>and</i> financial standing
of the Society.</p>

<h3>☛ Policemen and Magicians</h3>

<p>A visiting professor of Anguish, Dr. ——<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,
who, while learning to understand spoken English, was
continually bewildered and embarrassed by the similarity
of such expressions as <i>boys and girls</i> and <i>poisoned
gulls</i>, used to exclaim:</p>

<p>“Gracious! What a lot of words sound like each
other! If it wasn’t (<i>sic</i>) for the different situations in
which we hear ’em, we’d have a terrible time saying
which was which.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>Of course, these may not have been the professor’s
exact words, because he often did his exclaiming in
Anguish rather than in English. In that case he would
say:</p>

<p>“<i>Crashes! Water larders warts sunned lack itch udder!
Effervescent further deferent saturations an witch way
harem, wade heifer haliver tam sang witch worse witch.</i>”</p>

<p>Dr. —— was right, both in English and
Anguish. Although other factors than the pronunciation
of words affect our ability to understand them,
the situation in which the words are uttered is of prime
importance. You can easily prove this, right in the privacy
of your own kitchen, by asking a friend to help
you wash up a dozen cops and sorcerers. Ten to one,
she’ll think you said a dozen <i>cups and saucers</i>, and be
genuinely surprised if you put her to work cleaning up
even <i>one</i> police officer, let alone all the others, and the
magicians, too.</p>

<p>If you think that she misunderstands merely because
the two phrases sound somewhat alike and <i>not</i> because
of the situation, read what SPAL’s Committee on Housewives
has to say:</p>

<p>“Presented with a dishes-piled-in-sink situation, several
hundred well-adjusted housewives thought that <i>cops
and sorcerers</i> referred to dishes, but seldom did normal
subjects, interviewed under the same conditions, make
the opposite mistake. When they were asked to help us
wash <i>cups and saucers</i>, some women consented, some
made stupid excuses, and some told us bluntly to go
wash them ourselves, but <i>practically no one thought that
we were talking about policemen and magicians</i>.”</p>

<h3>What Anguish Really Is. ☚</h3>

<p>The experiments described above, and hundreds of
similar ones conducted by SPAL show that <i>an unbelievable
number of English words, regardless of their usual
meanings, can be substituted quite satisfactorily for
others</i>. When <i>all</i> the words in a given passage of English
have been so replaced, the passage keeps its original
meaning, but all the words have acquired new ones.
<i>A word that has received a new meaning has become a
<span class="antiqua">wart</span>, and when all the words in the passage have become
warts, the passage is no longer English; it’s <span class="antiqua">Anguish</span>.</i></p>

<h3>Are There Any Good Reasons to Study Anguish? ☚</h3>

<p>This is not an altogether silly question, and it deserves
the prompt and unequivocal answer any Anguish
Languish enthusiast will give it.</p>

<p>“<i>Watcher mane, ardor rainy gut raisins toe sturdy
anguish?</i>” he will say, and will probably give you an
impressive list of them which will certainly include
the following:</p>

<h4><i>1. Anguish is fun.</i></h4>

<p>You and your friends can make a game out of learning
Anguish, and you’ll have fun developing your own
style and observing each other’s efforts. How to begin
will be explained later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<h4><i>2. Anguish Languish means verbal economy.</i></h4>

<p>If words can be made to do double, triple, or even
quadruple duty, it is obvious that we don’t need so
many of them. Wouldn’t it be a comfort to know that,
in the event of some unpredictable disaster wiping out
half of our English vocabulary, we could, if we had
learned Anguish, get along nicely with what we had
left?<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h4><i>3. Anguish helps out in certain social situations.</i></h4>

<p>People who aren’t sure of themselves should learn
Anguish. Suppose you have been asked to dinner by
the president of your company and his wife. Since you
haven’t met your hostess, you have spent some time,
before going, thinking up something to say that will
really interest her. Finally you decide to ask, during the
dinner:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bellowell, didn’t I hear that your brother Henry
was discovered to be in collusion with those election
crooks?”</p>

<p>The moment arrives, but you no sooner get her attention
than you have sudden misgivings. Too late to
change your subject, you slip deftly into Anguish:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bellowell ... deaden are hair ditcher broader
Hennery worse dish-cupboard toe bang collision wet
dozer liquor-chin crocks?”</p>

<p>Chances are that everyone will be so fascinated by the
graceful form of your question that not even your hostess
will attach much importance to what you’ve asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p class="caption">EUROPE OILY DISK MOANING!</p>
<p class="caption">DOILY BOARD CASHES OR WARM!</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<h4><i>4. Anguish relieves that terrible craving to tell dialect stories.</i></h4>

<p>People who are addicted to telling dialect stories, or
chronically frustrated because they can’t tell them without
Scotch brogue or Brooklynese getting mixed up with
Deep South, will be overjoyed with Anguish. <i>Anguish
is definitely <span class="antiqua">not</span> a dialect,
since it consists <span class="antiqua">only</span> of unchanged
English words which anyone can pronounce.</i>
By imparting a delicate and indefinably exotic accent
to one’s speech, however, it not only provides a socially
acceptable substitute for telling dialect stories, but adds
to one’s personal charm.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<h4><i>5. Anguish improves your English.</i></h4>

<p>As your Anguish vocabulary increases, you’ll find that
your English vocabulary does, too, but you must be
careful not to mix them up—something which people
orphan do when they begin to use words accordion
to the way they sound rather than how they’re spelled.
Words which are rare in English are often common
enough in Anguish, so you have new opportunities to
see them. Suppose you’re spending a week-end reciting
nursery rhymes in Anguish to a happy group of children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
or immature adults, and come across <i>SING A SONG
OF SIXPENCE, A POCKET FULL OF RYE</i>. In
Anguish, this, of course, is <i>SINKER SUCKER SOCKS
PANTS, APOCRYPHAL AWRY</i>. This will give you
an unexpected chance to use the last two words.</p>

<p>You’d be surprised to know how many people haven’t
the faintest idea what a xyster is until they hear a SPAL
member talking about his fodder, murder, broader, and
xyster. This makes them want to look <i>xyster</i> up. When
they do, they find that, although <i>xyster</i><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in Anguish,
may mean <i>sister</i>, in English it’s nothing in the world
but a common raspatorium. Now raspatoria, and, therefore
xysters are important surgical instruments, nice to
know about before being scheduled for an aberration.</p>

<p>Speaking of xysters, hominy people know what <i>higglery</i>
is? Very few, yet it occurs in the Anguish Languish
version of something as well known as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Murder, mare argo art toe swarm?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yap, mar doling dodder,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hank yore clues honor higglery larme</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An dun gore norther warder!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>While you’re looking up <i>higglery</i>, you might find
<i>larme</i>, just a few pages away in Webster’s Unabridged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">

<p class="caption">“—<i>wail, debt worse inner laest wake off Dismember—nor,

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<h4><i>6. Practical Anguish.</i></h4>

<p>Anguish can be used for group study at parties and
entertainments; as a psychological test of something or
other (we don’t know just what),<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and as practice material
in Speech and Typing classes.</p>

<h3>How Can One Learn Anguish? ☚</h3>

<p>1. Read everything in this text aloud, and preferably
in a group. Make a game of it.</p>

<p>You’ll find it easier to understand Anguish when you
<i>hear</i> it than when you see it. If you have trouble, listen
to someone else read it to you, preferably someone who
doesn’t quite know what he’s reading. This often gives
the best effect. Watch what happens when the listeners
understand better than the reader.</p>

<p>2. Don’t try to read too fast and be sure to give all
words their usual English pronunciation, regardless of
the new meaning the word has acquired. An accurate
pronunciation and good intonation are most effective.</p>

<p>3. Don’t worry if you seem to have suddenly acquired
a slight accent; your friends will tell you that this is
most attractive.</p>

author concerning the Anguish Languish, especially the thousands who
wrote to request copies of LADLE RAT ROTTEN HUT after
Arthur Godfrey’s inimitable reading of it, on his television show.
The society is very poorly organized, in fact few of the members even
know they belong. There are no officers, no meetings, no convention,
and, worst of all, from the point of view of the author and
founder, no dues.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
